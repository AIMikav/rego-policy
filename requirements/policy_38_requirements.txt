Violation: authorization.openshift.io is deprecated

RBAC resources must not use the deprecated 'authorization.openshift.io' API group. From OCP4.2 onwards, you should migrate from 'authorization.openshift.io' to rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1. See: https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.2/html/release_notes/ocp-4-2-release-notes#ocp-4-2-deprecated-features
